This session will provide an overview of the composition and function of the gut microbiota with particular relevance given to the role of the microbiota in diabetes and metabolic disorders. Key takeaways will include an understanding of how the microbiota is measured and the relative merits of different techniques, an appreciation of the common visualisations that are used to display the highly multidimensional data that are produced from microbiota sequencing, including the ability to interpret these findings, and an awareness of future directions of this field, in particular the relevance of microbiota testing to patient care within hospital and clinic settings. This symposium will also provide an overview of the lifestyle factors influencing the composition of the gut microbiota, including dietary prebiotics and probiotics, physical activity and sleep quality. Interventions used to favourably manipulate the composition of the gut microbiota in diabetes will be discussed, including interpretation of the evidence supporting the efficacy of these interventions. Following attendance at this symposium, participants will be able to provide practical and evidence-based advice about gut microbial measurement and manipulation to their patients with diabetes.\n ","date":1566464400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560676801,"objectID":"b7e4b425de2f5291ac7e381e29489510","permalink":"/talk/2019-adc-3/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-adc-3/","section":"talk","summary":"Australasian Diabetes Congress 2019","tags":["diabetes","gut microbiota"],"title":"Diabetes and the gut microbiota: sorting through the crap","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Background: Excess intake of dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) contributes to chronic renal injury. Gut dysbiosis is implicated in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, however, the role of dietary AGEs in gut dysbiosis and renal injury in the context of type 2 diabetes has not yet been explored. This study investigated whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs promotes gut dysbiosis and exacerbates renal injury in diabetic mice, and if this could be ameliorated with resistant starch (RS) supplementation.\nMethods: Six-week-old diabetic mice (db/db) and non-diabetic mice (db/m) were randomised to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1h), with or without 12.5% RS for 10 weeks. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran. Cecal digesta were collected for an untargeted metabolomics screen and microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\nResults: The HAGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in diabetic mice which was attenuated by RS. The HAGE diet increased gut permeability of db/db mice, an effect not observed in HAGE+RS-fed db/db mice. In db/db mice, a HAGE diet was associated with an increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, which was ameliorated by supplementation with RS. High-AGE-fed db/db mice had a unique cecal metabolome with a marked increase in metabolites from the phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine pathways which were positively correlated with Firmicutes and negatively correlated with Bacteroidetes.\nConclusions: HAGE-feeding increased intestinal permeability and the F/B ratio, altered the cecal metabolome and worsened albuminuria in db/db mice. RS protected against HAGE-induced albuminuria and reversed changes observed in the microbiome and cecal metabolome. This study supports the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to DKD via alterations in gut homeostasis and indicate a potential renoprotective role for RS.\n ","date":1566460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560676801,"objectID":"38c88396a326b1796799fa9d60abe0bf","permalink":"/talk/2019-adc-2/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-adc-2/","section":"talk","summary":"Australasian Diabetes Congress 2019","tags":["advanced glycation endproducts","resistant starch","diabetic kidney disease"],"title":"Advanced Glycation Endproduct-Induced Albuminuria and Changes in Gut Microbiota and Metabolome are Attenuated by Resistant Starch in a Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Background: The gut microbiota is increasingly recognised to be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease. Studies using supraphysiological doses of dietary fibre to target the gut microbiota have shown promise in reducing albuminuria in animal models of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, there is limited data on the effects of dietary fibre interventions in the range of what could be reasonably expected to be consumed by humans.\nMethods: Six week old littermate C57BL6/J mice were randomised and half were rendered diabetic by five daily intraperitoneal injections of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin. Mice were randomised to receive 24 weeks of either a regular chow diet (CON) or a resistant starch diet (RS) that was supplemented with 25% high amylose maize starch (HAMS, equivalent to 12.5% RS). The diets were isocaloric and matched for protein, fat and micronutrient content. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria and urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary MCP-1 and albuminuria were measured by ELISA. Periodic acid-Schiff stained kidney sections were scored for glomerulosclerosis. Crypt depth and villi length were measured on haematoxylin and eosin stained ileum sections. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight).\nResults: Diabetes was associated with increased albuminuria, BUN, urinary MCP-1 and glomerulosclerosis, none of which were reduced with RS supplementation. Diabetes was associated with increased villi height and a reduction in crypt depth in the ileum, which was not altered with RS supplementation. Interestingly, despite these morphological changes in the intestine, neither diabetes nor resistant starch supplementation was associated with changes in in vivo intestinal permeability.\nConclusions: Supplementation with a diet containing 12.5% resistant starch was not protective against diabetic nephropathy in the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model.\n ","date":1566460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560676801,"objectID":"d17f7765f0e75d2da28e9b10d569b278","permalink":"/talk/2019-adc-1/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-adc-1/","section":"talk","summary":"Australasian Diabetes Congress 2019","tags":["advanced glycation endproducts","resistant starch","diabetic kidney disease"],"title":"Resistant starch supplementation is not associated with protection against diabetic nephropathy in the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Matthew Snelson**","Jessica Jong","Deanna Manolas","Smonda Kok","Audrey Louise","Romi Stern","Nicole Kellow"],"categories":null,"content":" Full Citation Matthew Snelson, Jessica Jong, Deanna Manolas, Smonda Kok, Audrey Louise, Romi Stern, Nicole J Kellow, Metabolic effects of resistant starch type 2: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, Nutrients, Volume 11, Issue 8, 2019, Page 1833\n","date":1564963200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564963200,"objectID":"be61e7deb1d16da4c8f14c8d276d2f0d","permalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_rs-slr/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_rs-slr/","section":"publication","summary":"Published evidence exploring the effects of dietary resistant starch (RS) on human cardiometabolic health is inconsistent. This review aimed to investigate the effect of dietary RS type 2 (RS2) supplementation on body weight, satiety ratings, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance and lipid levels in healthy individuals and those with overweight/obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Five electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English between 1982-2018, with trials eligible for inclusion if they reported RCTs involving humans where at least one group consumed ≥8 grams of RS2 per day and measured body weight, satiety, glucose and/or lipid metabolic outcomes. Twenty-two RCTs involving 670 participants were included. Meta-analyses indicated that RS2 supplementation significantly reduced serum triacylglycerol concentrations (mean difference (MD) = -0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.19, -0.01, P=0.03) in healthy individuals (n=269) and reduced body weight (MD = -1.29 kg; 95% CI -2.40, -0.17, P=0.02) in people with T2DM (n=90), however these outcomes were heavily influenced by positive results from a small number of individual studies which contradicted the conclusions of the majority of trials. RS2 had no effects on any other metabolic outcomes. All studies ranged from 1-12 weeks in duration, contained small sample sizes (10-60 participants) and most had an unclear risk of bias. Short-term RS2 supplementation in humans is of limited cardiometabolic benefit.","tags":["Resistant Starch","Metabolic Syndrome","Diabetes"],"title":"Metabolic effects of resistant starch type 2: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Matthew Snelson**","Sih Min Tan","Runa Lindblom","Gavin Higgins","Charles Mackay","Melinda Coughlan"],"categories":null,"content":" Full Citation Matthew Snelson, Sih Min Tan, Runa SJ Lindblom, Gavin C Higgins, Charles R Mackay, Melinda T Coughlan, Resistant starch does not protect against nephropathy or alter intestinal permeability in an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model, bioRxiv 713354\n","date":1564531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564531200,"objectID":"995ea0b0de97af5e3e27bf08934e3718","permalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_gpr109a/","publishdate":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_gpr109a/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Alterations in gut homeostasis may contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Resistant starch (RS) is a prebiotic fibre that promotes the production of butyrate by the gut microbiota. Butyrate acts as a ligand for G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPR)190a, decreasing intestinal inflammation and promoting gut epithelial barrier integrity in induced-colitis models. This study aimed to assess the effects of: (i) a diet supplemented with the physiological concentration of 12.5% RS and (ii) GPR109a deletion on the progression of DN. METHODS: Male mice that were homozygous for GPR109a deletion or their wildtype littermates were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin. Mice received either a control diet or an isocaloric diet containing 12.5% RS for 24 weeks. Renal injury was assessed by urine albumin and renal histology. Ileum histology was evaluated and gastrointestinal permeability was determined in vivo using the FITC-dextran test and ex vivo by expression of ileum tight junction proteins. RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with increased albuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, glomerulosclerosis index scores and urinary MCP-1, none of which were altered with RS supplementation or GPR109a deletion. Whilst diabetes was associated with alterations in intestinal morphology, intestinal permeability was unaltered and RS supplementation had no effect on intestinal permeability nor morphology. GPR109a deletion did not worsen DN or alter gastrointestinal homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-four weeks of supplementation of 12.5% RS does not protect against the development of DN in the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. Further, GPR109a does not appear to play a critical role in intestinal homeostasis or in the development of DN.","tags":["resistant starch","diabetic kidney disease"],"title":"Resistant starch does not protect against nephropathy or alter intestinal permeability in an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Snelson"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

The modern processed diet is replete with AGEs, and excessive AGE consumption is thought to be associated with a number of negative health effects. Many dietary AGEs have high molecular weight and are not absorbed in the intestine, and instead pass through to the colon, where they are available for metabolism by the colonic bacteria. Recent studies have been conducted to explore the effects of AGEs on the composition of the gut microbiota as well as the production of beneficial microbial metabolites, in particular, short-chain fatty acids. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of dietary AGEs on gut microbiota reshaping, which may be due, in part, to the formation of alternate compounds during the thermal treatment of foods. This review summarises the current evidence regarding dietary sources of AGEs, their gastrointestinal absorption and role in gut microbiota reshaping, provides a brief overview of the health implications of dietary AGEs and highlights knowledge gaps and avenues for future study.","tags":["Advanced Glycation Endproducts","Gut Microbiota"],"title":"Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products: Digestion, Metabolism and Modulation of Gut Microbial Ecology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Matthew Snelson**","Nicole Kellow","Melinda Coughlan"],"categories":null,"content":" Full Citation Matthew Snelson, Nicole J Kellow, Melinda T Coughlan, Modulation of the Gut Microbiota by Resistant Starch as a Treatment of Chronic Kidney Diseases: Evidence of Efficacy and Mechanistic Insights, Advances in Nutrition, Volume 10, Issue 2, March 2019, Pages 303–320\n","date":1548028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548028800,"objectID":"8d7100509274b1c0d83e7ff8efa8c1fe","permalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_rs_ckd/","publishdate":"2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_snelson_rs_ckd/","section":"publication","summary":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been associated with changes in gut microbial ecology, or “dysbiosis,” which may contribute to disease progression. Recent studies have focused on dietary approaches to favorably alter the composition of the gut microbial communities as a treatment method in CKD. Resistant starch (RS), a prebiotic that promotes proliferation of gut bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, increases the production of metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, which confer a number of health-promoting benefits. However, there is a lack of mechanistic insight into how these metabolites can positively influence renal health. Emerging evidence shows that microbiota-derived metabolites can regulate the incretin axis and mitigate inflammation via expansion of regulatory T cells. Studies from animal models and patients with CKD show that RS supplementation attenuates the concentrations of uremic retention solutes, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. Here, we present the current state of knowledge linking the microbiome to CKD, we explore the efficacy of RS in animal models of CKD and in humans with the condition, and we discuss how RS supplementation could be a promising dietary approach for slowing CKD progression.","tags":["Resistant Starch","Chronic Kidney Disease"],"title":"Modulation of the Gut Microbiota by Resistant Starch as a Treatment of Chronic Kidney Diseases: Evidence of Efficacy and Mechanistic Insights","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Published evidence exploring effects of dietary resistant starch (RS) on cardiometabolic health is inconsistent.

Recent research implicates gut dysbiosis in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, however, the role of dietary AGEs in gut dysbiosis and renal injury in the context of diabetes has not yet been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs cause gut dysbiosis, exacerbating renal injury in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. A secondary aim was to elucidate whether a high fibre diet (resistant starch), may be protective against diabetic nephropathy via altering gut homeostasis. Methods: Six week old diabetic mice (db/db) (BKS.Cg-Dock7m+/+Leprdb/J) on a C57BL/KsJ background and age-matched non-diabetic control mice (db/m) were randomised (n=12/group) to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1 hour), with or without 25% resistant starch (RS) for 10 weeks. All diets were isocaloric. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria. At 15 weeks of age, mice were fasted and an oral glucose tolerance test (2g/kg lean body mass) was performed. At 16 weeks of age, intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight). Glycated haemoglobin was assessed using a Roche cobas b101 analyser.\nResults: The high AGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in db/db mice (874.4±154.8 vs 536.2±96.5μg/24h, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), and this AGE-induced increase in albuminuria was attenuated by RS (874.4±154.8 vs 515.5±71.9μg/24h, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE + RS). Db/db mice had increased gut permeability compared to db/m mice (2.38±0.32 vs 1.05±0.11μg/ml, P\u0026lt;0.01, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE). Furthermore, the high AGE diet increased gut permeability of db/db mice (3.43±0.43 vs 2.38±0.32μg/ml, P=0.06, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), an effect not observed in RS-fed db/db mice (2.38±0.32 vs 2.86±0.35μg/ml, P\u0026gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS). Following OGTT, db/db mice had a higher glucose AUC (74.08±5.98 vs 17.54±2.32 mmol/L x min, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE) and glycated haemoglobin (10.47±1.96 vs 4.06±0.12, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE) compared to db/m mice. Neither the high AGE diet nor the resistant starch supplemented diets influenced glycaemic control in db/db or db/m mice, as reflected by OGTT AUC (74.08±5.98 vs 75.29±6.45 vs 75.29±6.45 vs 72.64±7.16 mmol/L x min, P\u0026gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS vs db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS), or glycated haemoglobin (10.61±0.46 vs 9.65±0.55 vs 10.98±0.67 vs 10.58±0.67 % glycated haemoglobin, P\u0026gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS vs db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS).\nConclusions: A high AGE diet led to increased intestinal permeability, which was associated with worsening albuminuria in db/db mice. Resistant starch was protective against high AGE induced albuminuria in db/db mice, effects which are not dependant on changes in glucose homeostasis. These preliminary studies support the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to renal disease via alterations in gut homeostasis and suggest a potential role for resistant starch as a renoprotective agent.\n ","date":1505376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560676801,"objectID":"e7bf17f02ea826f2f6fe1227ffdbfb3f","permalink":"/talk/2017-easd/","publishdate":"2017-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-easd/","section":"talk","summary":"53rd Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes","tags":["advanced glycation endproducts","resistant starch","diabetic kidney disease"],"title":"Resistant Starch Ameliorates Advanced Glycation Endproduct-Induced Albuminuria in a Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Matthew Snelson**","John Mamo","Virginie Lam","Corey Giles","Ryusuke Takechi"],"categories":null,"content":" Full Citation Matthew Snelson, John Mamo, Virginie Lam, Corey Giles, Ryusuke Takechi, Differential Effects of High-Protein Diets Derived from Soy and Casein on Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity in Wild-type Mice, Frontiers in Nutrition, Volume 4, Issue 35, 2017\n","date":1500854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500854400,"objectID":"9d05f24b6058d46fdcd1c1e73cca3f2c","permalink":"/publication/2017_snelson_bbb-hp/","publishdate":"2017-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_snelson_bbb-hp/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of studies report that a diet high in protein influences cognitive performance, but the results are inconsistent. Studies demonstrated that protein from different food sources has differential effects on cognition. It is increasingly recognized that the integrity of cerebrovascular blood–brain barrier (BBB) is pivotal for central nervous system function. However, to date, no studies have reported the effects of high-protein diets on BBB integrity. Therefore, in this study, the effects of diets enriched in casein or soy protein on BBB permeability were investigated. Immunomicroscopy analyses of cerebral parenchymal immunoglobulin G extravasation indicated significant BBB disruption in the cortex of young adult mice maintained on high-casein diet for 12 weeks, while no signs of BBB dysfunction were observed in mice fed with control or high-soy protein diet. Moreover, cortical expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was significantly greater in mice fed the high-casein diet compared to control mice, indicating heightened astrocyte activation, whereas mice maintained on a soy-enriched diet showed no increase of GFAP abundance. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine were markedly greater in mice maintained on a high-casein diet in comparison to control mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that a diet enriched in casein but not soy protein may induce astrocyte activation through exaggerated BBB permeability by increased plasma homocysteine. The outcomes indicate the differential effects of protein sources on BBB and neuroinflammation, which may provide an important implication for dietary guidelines for protein supplementation.","tags":["High Protein Diets","Blood Brain Barrier"],"title":"Differential Effects of High-Protein Diets Derived from Soy and Casein on Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity in Wild-type Mice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Matthew Snelson**","Rachel Clarke","Melinda Coughlan"],"categories":null,"content":" Full Citation Matthew Snelson, Rachel E Clarke, Melinda T Coughlan, Stirring the Pot: Can Dietary Modification Alleviate the Burden of CKD?, Nutrients, Volume 9, Issue 3, 2017, Page 265\n","date":1489190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489190400,"objectID":"eaa6ef58207ff27e22c4012d536bc0c8","permalink":"/publication/2017_snelson_diet_ckd/","publishdate":"2017-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_snelson_diet_ckd/","section":"publication","summary":"Diet is one of the largest modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related death and disability.

Dietary therapy such as protein and sodium restriction has historically been used in the management of CKD. Evidence is emerging to indicate that other nutrients may influence kidney health, either through metabolic or haemodynamic pathways or via the modification of gut homeostasis. This review focuses on the role of diet in the pathogenesis and progression of CKD and discusses the latest findings related to the mechanisms of diet-induced kidney disease. It is possible that optimizing diet quality or restricting dietary intake could be harnessed as an adjunct therapy for CKD prevention or progression in susceptible individuals, thereby reducing the burden of CKD.","tags":["Diet","Chronic Kidney Disease"],"title":"Stirring the Pot: Can Dietary Modification Alleviate the Burden of CKD?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Background/Aims: Heat treating foods leads to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) which contribute to chronic renal injury. Recent research implicates gut dysbiosis in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. This study investigates whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs causes gut dysbiosis, exacerbating renal injury in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. Methods: Six week old diabetic (db/db) and non-diabetic (db/h) mice were randomised (n=12/group) to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1 hour), with or without resistant starch (RS) for 10 weeks. 24-hour urine was collected and albuminuria was measured. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight). Statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA. Results: The high AGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in db/db mice (874.4±154.8 vs 536.2±96.5µg/24h, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), and RS attenuated this AGE-induced increase (874.4±154.8 vs 515.5±71.9µg/24h, P\u0026lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS). Db/db mice had greater gut permeability compared to db/h mice (2.38±0.32 vs 1.05±0.11µg/ml, P\u0026lt;0.01, db/db LAGE vs db/h LAGE). Db/db-HAGE-fed mice trended towards increased gut permeability (3.43±0.43 vs 2.38±0.32µg/ml, P=0.06, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), an effect not observed in RS-fed db/db mice. Conclusions: Heat-treated diets led to increased intestinal permeability and worsening albuminuria in db/db mice. RS was protective against high AGE-induced albuminuria in db/db mice. These preliminary studies support the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to renal disease via alterations in gut homeostasis.\n ","date":1480492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560676801,"objectID":"dc2ce69cfd4d4376c6e79ea87e68859d","permalink":"/talk/2016-nsa/","publishdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-nsa/","section":"talk","summary":"Nutrition Society of Australia 41st Annual Scientific Meeting","tags":["advanced glycation endproducts","resistant starch","diabetic kidney disease"],"title":"Resistant Starch Ameliorates Heat Treated Diet-Induced Gut Permeability and Renal Dysfunction in Experimental Diabetes","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract: Aim: To investigate whether excess consumption of dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) cause gut dysbiosis, exacerbating renal injury in a type 2 diabetes model.\nBackground: Long-term excess intake of dietary AGEs contributes to chronic renal injury.
