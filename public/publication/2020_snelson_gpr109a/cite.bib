	abstract = {Alterations in gut homeostasis may contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There has been recent attention on the renoprotective effects of metabolite-sensing receptors in chronic renal injury, including the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPR)109a, which ligates the short chain fatty acid butyrate. However, the role of GPR109a in the development of diabetic nephropathy, a milieu of diminished microbiome-derived metabolites, has not yet been determined. This study aimed to assess the effects of insufficient GPR109a signalling via genetic deletion of GPR109a on the development of renal injury in diabetic nephropathy. Gpr109a−/− mice or their wildtype littermates (Gpr109a+/+) were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ). Mice received a control diet or an isocaloric high fiber diet (12.5% resistant starch) for 24 weeks and gastrointestinal permeability and renal injury were determined. Diabetes was associated with increased albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and inflammation. In comparison, Gpr109a−/− mice with diabetes did not show an altered renal phenotype. Resistant starch supplementation did not afford protection from renal injury in diabetic nephropathy. Whilst diabetes was associated with alterations in intestinal morphology, intestinal permeability assessed in vivo using the FITC-dextran test was unaltered. GPR109a deletion did not worsen gastrointestinal permeability. Further, 12.5% resistant starch supplementation, at physiological concentrations, had no effect on intestinal permeability or morphology. These studies indicate that GPR109a does not play a critical role in intestinal homeostasis in a model of type 1 diabetes or in the development of diabetic nephropathy.},
