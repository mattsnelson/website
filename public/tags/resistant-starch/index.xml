&lt;div id=&#34;abstract&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background:
Excess intake of dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) contributes to chronic renal injury. Gut dysbiosis is implicated in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, however, the role of dietary AGEs in gut dysbiosis and renal injury in the context of type 2 diabetes has not yet been explored. This study investigated whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs promotes gut dysbiosis and exacerbates renal injury in diabetic mice, and if this could be ameliorated with resistant starch (RS) supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods:
Six-week-old diabetic mice (db/db) and non-diabetic mice (db/m) were randomised to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1h), with or without 12.5% RS for 10 weeks. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran. Cecal digesta were collected for an untargeted metabolomics screen and microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:
The HAGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in diabetic mice which was attenuated by RS. The HAGE diet increased gut permeability of db/db mice, an effect not observed in HAGE+RS-fed db/db mice. In db/db mice, a HAGE diet was associated with an increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, which was ameliorated by supplementation with RS. High-AGE-fed db/db mice had a unique cecal metabolome with a marked increase in metabolites from the phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine pathways which were positively correlated with Firmicutes and negatively correlated with Bacteroidetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:
HAGE-feeding increased intestinal permeability and the F/B ratio, altered the cecal metabolome and worsened albuminuria in db/db mice. RS protected against HAGE-induced albuminuria and reversed changes observed in the microbiome and cecal metabolome. This study supports the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to DKD via alterations in gut homeostasis and indicate a potential renoprotective role for RS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background:
The gut microbiota is increasingly recognised to be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease. Studies using supraphysiological doses of dietary fibre to target the gut microbiota have shown promise in reducing albuminuria in animal models of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, there is limited data on the effects of dietary fibre interventions in the range of what could be reasonably expected to be consumed by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods:
Six week old littermate C57BL6/J mice were randomised and half were rendered diabetic by five daily intraperitoneal injections of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin. Mice were randomised to receive 24 weeks of either a regular chow diet (CON) or a resistant starch diet (RS) that was supplemented with 25% high amylose maize starch (HAMS, equivalent to 12.5% RS). The diets were isocaloric and matched for protein, fat and micronutrient content. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria and urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary MCP-1 and albuminuria were measured by ELISA. Periodic acid-Schiff stained kidney sections were scored for glomerulosclerosis. Crypt depth and villi length were measured on haematoxylin and eosin stained ileum sections. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:
Diabetes was associated with increased albuminuria, BUN, urinary MCP-1 and glomerulosclerosis, none of which were reduced with RS supplementation. Diabetes was associated with increased villi height and a reduction in crypt depth in the ileum, which was not altered with RS supplementation. Interestingly, despite these morphological changes in the intestine, neither diabetes nor resistant starch supplementation was associated with changes in in vivo intestinal permeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:
Supplementation with a diet containing 12.5% resistant starch was not protective against diabetic nephropathy in the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published evidence exploring effects of dietary resistant starch (RS) on cardiometabolic health is inconsistent. This review aimed to investigate the effect of dietary RS type 2 (RS2) supplementation on body weight, satiety ratings, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance and lipid levels in healthy individuals and those with overweight/obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Five electronic databases were searched for Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) published in English between 1982-2017, investigating the effect of dietary RS2 supplementation on cardiometabolic health.
Trials were eligible for inclusion if they reported RCTs involving humans where at least one group received ≥10 grams of RS2 per day for ≥1 week, and measured body weight, satiety, glucose and/or lipid metabolic outcomes. Twenty RCTs involving 569 participants were included. RS2 supplementation significantly reduced serum triacylglycerol concentrations (Mean difference= -0.11 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.18, -0.04, P=0.002) in healthy individuals (n=227) and reduced body weight (MD= -1.29kg; 95% CI -2.40, -0.17, P=0.02) in people with T2DM (n=90), but had no effect on appetite, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol in any patient sub-groups. Most studies had a moderate-high risk of bias, were of short duration and contained small sample sizes. High quality, long-term trials are required to determine the efficacy of RS2 supplementation as a dietary strategy in the management of metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement activation occurs in diabetic nephropathy with the downstream complement component C5a activating the innate immune system, contributing to inflammation. Resistant starch (RS) may be nephro-protective however the effects of RS on complement activation and the innate immune system have not been explored. Six week old non-diabetic mice (dbh), diabetic mice (dbdb) and dbdb mice on a regular chow diet supplemented with 25% RS (dbdbRS) were maintained for ten weeks. 24-hour urine was collected for albumin and C5a measurement by ELISA. Kidneys were digested and enriched for leukocytes using Percoll gradient and flow cytometry was performed. Diabetes was associated with an increase in albuminuria (28.0±6.5 vs 411.3±275.8µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb), which was reduced in diabetic mice receiving RS supplementation (411.3±275.8 vs 125.6±37.3µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.01, dbdb vs dbdbRS). Urinary C5a excretion was increased by diabetes (92.6±17.6 vs 1324.0±429.7pg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb) and decreased by RS (1324.0±429.7 vs 577.7±123.1pg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, dbdb vs dbdbRS) and infiltrating renal macrophages were more likely to be positive for C5aR with diabetes (4.8±3.9 vs 54.0±27.8%, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb), which RS supplementation reduced (54.0±27.8 vs 11.7±4.2%, P&amp;lt;0.01, dbdb vs dbdbRS). These studies support the notion that RS is protective against renal disease via inhibition of complement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim
To investigate immune mechanisms by which resistant starch (RS) supplementation may be protective against diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background
Activation of complement occurs in diabetic nephropathy. C5a is a downstream complement component that activates the innate immune system contributing to inflammation. Dietary RS may be nephro-protective, however the effects of dietary RS on complement activation and the innate immune system have not been explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods
Six week old non-diabetic mice (db/h), diabetic mice (db/db) and db/db mice on a regular chow diet supplemented with 25% RS (dbdb+RS) were maintained for ten weeks. 24-hour urine was collected for albumin and C5a measurement by ELISA. Kidneys were digested and enriched for leukocytes using Percoll gradient. Cells were stained with BV786-CD45, AF700-CD11b, PE-Cy7-CD11c, BV711-Siglec F, BV605-Ly6C, PE-CD86, FITC-C5aR antibodies and flow cytometry was performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results
Diabetes was associated with an increase in albuminuria (28.0±6.5 vs 411.3±275.8µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb), which was reduced in diabetic mice receiving RS supplementation (411.3±275.8 vs 125.6±37.3µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.01, dbdb vs dbdb+RS). Urinary C5a excretion was increased by diabetes (92.6±17.6 vs 1324.0±429.7pg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb) and decreased by RS (1324.0±429.7 vs 577.7±123.1pg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, dbdb vs dbdb+RS). In diabetes there was an increase in CD86 MFI (a marker of activation) on infiltrating macrophages (CD45+ CD11b+ CD11c- Siglec F- Ly6C hi), which was attenuated with RS (3.7±1.8 vs 1.5±1.0 fold change to dbh, P&amp;lt;0.05, dbdb vs dbdb+RS). Furthermore, infiltrating macrophages were more likely to be positive for C5aR with diabetes (4.8±3.9 vs 54.0±27.8%, P&amp;lt;0.001, dbh vs dbdb), which RS supplementation reduced (54.0±27.8 vs 11.7±4.2%, P&amp;lt;0.01, dbdb vs dbdb+RS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions
These studies support the notion that dietary RS is protective against renal disease via inhibition of complement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;abstract&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background and Aim: Long-term excess intake of dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) contributes to chronic renal injury. Recent research implicates gut dysbiosis in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, however, the role of dietary AGEs in gut dysbiosis and renal injury in the context of diabetes has not yet been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs cause gut dysbiosis, exacerbating renal injury in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. A secondary aim was to elucidate whether a high fibre diet (resistant starch), may be protective against diabetic nephropathy via altering gut homeostasis. Methods: Six week old diabetic mice (db/db) (BKS.Cg-Dock7m+/+Leprdb/J) on a C57BL/KsJ background and age-matched non-diabetic control mice (db/m) were randomised (n=12/group) to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1 hour), with or without 25% resistant starch (RS) for 10 weeks. All diets were isocaloric. 24-hour urine was collected for the assessment of albuminuria. At 15 weeks of age, mice were fasted and an oral glucose tolerance test (2g/kg lean body mass) was performed. At 16 weeks of age, intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight). Glycated haemoglobin was assessed using a Roche cobas b101 analyser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The high AGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in db/db mice (874.4±154.8 vs 536.2±96.5μg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), and this AGE-induced increase in albuminuria was attenuated by RS (874.4±154.8 vs 515.5±71.9μg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE + RS). Db/db mice had increased gut permeability compared to db/m mice (2.38±0.32 vs 1.05±0.11μg/ml, P&amp;lt;0.01, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE). Furthermore, the high AGE diet increased gut permeability of db/db mice (3.43±0.43 vs 2.38±0.32μg/ml, P=0.06, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), an effect not observed in RS-fed db/db mice (2.38±0.32 vs 2.86±0.35μg/ml, P&amp;gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS). Following OGTT, db/db mice had a higher glucose AUC (74.08±5.98 vs 17.54±2.32 mmol/L x min, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE) and glycated haemoglobin (10.47±1.96 vs 4.06±0.12, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/m LAGE) compared to db/m mice. Neither the high AGE diet nor the resistant starch supplemented diets influenced glycaemic control in db/db or db/m mice, as reflected by OGTT AUC (74.08±5.98 vs 75.29±6.45 vs 75.29±6.45 vs 72.64±7.16 mmol/L x min, P&amp;gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS vs db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS), or glycated haemoglobin (10.61±0.46 vs 9.65±0.55 vs 10.98±0.67 vs 10.58±0.67 % glycated haemoglobin, P&amp;gt;0.05, db/db LAGE vs db/db LAGE+RS vs db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: A high AGE diet led to increased intestinal permeability, which was associated with worsening albuminuria in db/db mice. Resistant starch was protective against high AGE induced albuminuria in db/db mice, effects which are not dependant on changes in glucose homeostasis. These preliminary studies support the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to renal disease via alterations in gut homeostasis and suggest a potential role for resistant starch as a renoprotective agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background/Aims: Heat treating foods leads to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) which contribute to chronic renal injury. Recent research implicates gut dysbiosis in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. This study investigates whether excess consumption of dietary AGEs causes gut dysbiosis, exacerbating renal injury in a type 2 diabetes mouse model.
Methods: Six week old diabetic (db/db) and non-diabetic (db/h) mice were randomised (n=12/group) to receive a low AGE (LAGE, unbaked rodent chow) or a high AGE diet (HAGE, baked at 160°C for 1 hour), with or without resistant starch (RS) for 10 weeks. 24-hour urine was collected and albuminuria was measured. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by the clearance of FITC-labelled dextran (500mg/kg body weight). Statistical differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA.
Results: The high AGE diet exacerbated albuminuria in db/db mice (874.4±154.8 vs 536.2±96.5µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), and RS attenuated this AGE-induced increase (874.4±154.8 vs 515.5±71.9µg/24h, P&amp;lt;0.05, db/db HAGE vs db/db HAGE+RS). Db/db mice had greater gut permeability compared to db/h mice (2.38±0.32 vs 1.05±0.11µg/ml, P&amp;lt;0.01, db/db LAGE vs db/h LAGE). Db/db-HAGE-fed mice trended towards increased gut permeability (3.43±0.43 vs 2.38±0.32µg/ml, P=0.06, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), an effect not observed in RS-fed db/db mice.
Conclusions: Heat-treated diets led to increased intestinal permeability and worsening albuminuria in db/db mice. RS was protective against high AGE-induced albuminuria in db/db mice. These preliminary studies support the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to renal disease via alterations in gut homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, the high AGE diet tended to increase gut permeability of db/db mice (3.43±0.43 vs 2.38±0.32µg/ml, P=0.06, db/db HAGE vs db/db LAGE), an effect not observed in RS-fed db/db mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: A high AGE diet led to increased intestinal permeability, which was associated with worsening albuminuria in db/db mice. Resistant starch was protective against high AGE induced albuminuria in db/db mice. These preliminary studies support the notion that dietary AGEs contribute to renal disease via alterations in gut homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diet high in advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may activate pathways involved in chronic disease progression thereby exacerbating pre-existing pathology. The majority of diet-derived AGEs escape digestion and reach the colon, and previous studies suggest that dietary AGEs can modulate the gut microbiota, though a comprehensive metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiota has not been previously performed. C57BL6/J mice (n=10/group) were randomised to receive a low AGE diet (unbaked rodent chow, AIN93G) or a high AGE diet (baked AIN93G rodent chow, 160°C for 1h, resulting in a 5-fold higher AGE content) for 24 weeks. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to profile the gut microbiome and showed that mice receiving a high AGE diet had an increase in cecal bacterial diversity compared to the low AGE diet. Analysis of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) at the family level showed an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Heliobacteraceae and a decrease in Lachnospiraceae and Saccharibacteria. There was also a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila species and genus Ruminococcus. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, a marker of inflammation, and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a marker of bacterial translocation measured by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay, were both increased after high AGE feeding. Gene expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin was assessed by qPCR and found to be downregulated in ileum and jejenum respectively. These novel data indicate that excessive dietary intake of AGEs alters the gut microbiome, induces intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation to the circulation, supporting the notion that diet-derived AGEs can promote inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
