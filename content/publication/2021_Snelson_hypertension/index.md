abstract: "
An important mechanism of action of SCFAs is via ligation with metabolite-sensing G-protein–coupled receptors. 5 Thus, we sought to determine whether these receptors were involved in Ace2 regulation. Given the significant redundancy between these receptors, 5 we chose a newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat–associated 9) triple knockout model that lacks GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A to explore this. We observed that deletion of these 3 receptors was associated with a significant
