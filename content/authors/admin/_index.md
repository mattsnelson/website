I am a dietitian and Research Fellow in the [Department of Diabetes, Central Clinical School](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/ccs/diabetes) interested in the role of diet in altering disease states via modulation of the gut microbiota. 

I completed my PhD at Monash University in 2019 in the [Coughlan Laboratory](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/ccs/diabetes/research/coughlan-group), investigating the effects of a processed diet on gut homeostasis and the contribution that these changes make to the development of diabetic kidney disease. I am currently investigating the role of resistant starch on the development of diabetic nephropathy.
